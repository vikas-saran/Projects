User Interface (GUI):

The GUI is implemented using the Tkinter library in Python, providing a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the steganography functionalities.
Hide Message Functionality:

Allows users to select an image file and enter a message to hide within the image.
Encrypts the message with a user-provided password before embedding it into the image using the least significant bit (LSB) method.
The modified image with the hidden message is saved as a new file.
Extract Message Functionality:

Enables users to select an image containing a hidden message and provide the password used for encryption.
Extracts the hidden message from the image by applying the LSB method in reverse and decrypts it using the provided password.
Displays the extracted message in the GUI for the user to view.
Password Protection:

Utilizes a password-based encryption scheme to secure the hidden message within the image.
Users are prompted to enter a password during both message hiding and extraction processes.
The same password is required to decrypt the message during extraction.
Libraries Used:
Tkinter:

Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python, providing a set of tools for creating graphical user interfaces.
PIL (Python Imaging Library):

PIL, now maintained as Pillow, is a library for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It is used to handle image operations in the steganography project.
Additional Information:
Steganography Techniques:

Explain the concept of steganography, which involves hiding secret information within an ordinary, non-secret file or message to avoid detection.
Discuss various steganographic techniques, such as LSB insertion, which modifies the least significant bits of pixel values in an image to embed hidden data.
Security Considerations:

Highlight the importance of password protection in steganography to secure the hidden message.
Discuss the strength of the encryption scheme used and potential vulnerabilities, such as brute-force attacks on weak passwords.
File Formats and Compatibility:

Explain the supported image file formats for hiding and extracting messages (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
Discuss any limitations or compatibility issues with certain file formats or image properties.
Performance Considerations:

Address performance considerations, such as the size of the message that can be hidden within an image and the impact on image quality.
Discuss optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of hiding and extracting messages, especially for large images or messages.
Use Cases and Applications:

Discuss real-world use cases and applications of steganography, such as covert communication, digital watermarking, and data embedding in multimedia files.
Explore ethical considerations and legal implications of using steganography in various contexts.
Future Improvements:

Consider potential enhancements or features to improve the steganography project, such as support for additional encryption algorithms, user authentication mechanisms, or advanced image processing techniques.
Discuss challenges and research opportunities in the field of steganography for further exploration.
